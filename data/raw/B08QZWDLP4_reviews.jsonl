The cups, lids, and even the blender top just retain smells (not mold, but the smells of previous meals) that overall speak to the product being of poor quality.\n\nYou can’t put too many frozen pieces of fruit in here, because the blades aren’t that sharp and it will take multiple cycles to crush up the fruit into a yogurt consistency at best. The product after all this time also overheats when I have to blend more than twice.\n\nOverall, if you can’t buy anything better and want a cheap blender go ahead and get this one.
