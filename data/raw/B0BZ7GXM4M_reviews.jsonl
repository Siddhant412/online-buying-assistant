I work exclusively remote and finally traded in my old clunky ugly desk with a manual desk topper thing to stand up/down for this desk. I looked at so many desks but this one is small and I didn’t want a huge desk taking over the room. I got the desk, keyboard under mount and the monitor holder (all separate) but they work together amazingly!! My husband had no issues with assembling the various parts. I didn’t even know the motor thing has a timer included, where you can set the timer for .5 to 4 hours and it will give you the much needed reminder to stand up or sit down! I am guilty of sitting for hours otherwise. Having the under mount keyboard has completely fixed my terrible hunched shoulder position that was really messing with my traps and shoulders while working. I should have bought this desk and whole setup years ago. I just hope the motor lasts for several years", "rating": 5.0, "date": "December 14, 2025", "verified": false, "helpful_votes": 0}

The wood on the back where the monitors are supposed to sit seem strong, but the front part seems very flimsy. I feel if I push my self up from it enough times, the dowels will eventually snap.
