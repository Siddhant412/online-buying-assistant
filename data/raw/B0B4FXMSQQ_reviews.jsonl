This cookware is pretty & the porcelain is still smooth & clean after 6 months of use. No pits or cracks! The pans are solid & durable with pretty glass lids. I was a little unsure of the wooden handles but they are great; waterproof & I’ve used them in the oven for short periods of time. But here is the BEST part, it REALLY is nonstick! Cleanup is a breeze because nothing sticks. Nothing! It’s amazing. I’m an avid cook & have been serving up meals almost nightly for 40 years & I have never loved a cookware set like I love this. I use the 10” skillet almost daily for high temp frying & sautéing & though the bottom porcelain has darkened some, it is still solid & completely non stick.
